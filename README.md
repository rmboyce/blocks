A tetris clone for the HP Prime Graphing Calculator.

This is a tetris clone made for the HP Prime graphing calculator written in the HP BASIC programming language that the calculator uses. I made it by making a bunch of improvements to Kevin Barbier’s “BRICKS” game (you can see the changes in the changelog). 

The easiest way to get the program onto an HP Prime is to install the HP Prime Connectivity Kit (http://www.hp-prime.de/en/category/15-software) on your computer and to connect your computer and HP Prime with the charging cable. Then you can make a new file (call it “BLOCKS”) and copy the program over. To run the game, use Shift + 1 to get to the programs menu and just run the “BROCKS” program.
